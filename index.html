		<p>Hey! If you are reading this and your name is not Nick, im actually really surprised as to how you found this. Don't get me wrong, im super glad to have you. Anyway, this website serves as an archive of my journey through learning different programming languages, and also for a personal record of what I have accomplished. Feel free to look around, expand on what I've done, and if you see something that is so bad that you cant stand it, contact me at  nrbentlage@gmail.com and let me know! </p>
